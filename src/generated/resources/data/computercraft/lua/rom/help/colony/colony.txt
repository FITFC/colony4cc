The colony API is only available when a Colony Peripheral is attached to the computer at startup.  This assumes that you only have one such peripheral attached.
Note that the global API may misbehave if you move the Peripheral block while the computer is running.  To recover from this, just restart the computer by holding Ctrl+R or reloading your save.

You can also use peripheral.wrap to select a specific peripheral if multiple are connected for some reason, although this is unlikely to be useful.

Functions in the colony API:
colony.isValid() => boolean
colony.isWithin(table pos) => boolean
colony.getInfo() => table
colony.getBuildings() => table
colony.getCitizens() => table
colony.getVisitors() => table
colony.getWorkOrders() => table
colony.getWorkOrderResources(number id) => table
colony.getBuilderResources(table pos) => table
colony.getRequests() => table
colony.getResearch() => table
